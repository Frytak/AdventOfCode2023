# AdventOfCode2023
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), or to challenge each other.

As alwaays, I'm participating to learn more stuff and have fun while doing it! This year, I'm using the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) as most of the time I was in touch with higher level languages. I decided not to use any code libraries besides the standard ones, or any more advanced software for managing C builds (often also for testing and packaging) such as [CMake](https://cmake.org/), I'm limiting myself to the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) C Compiler from the [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection).
